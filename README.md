# Features

- Makes estimates about difficulty, block mining time, network hash rate, and mining earnings
- Uses actual data off of recent blocks in the blockchain itself as input.
- Calculate average time between recent blocks
- Estimates future earnings
- Can read blocks from json files on a local disk for performance and to avoid network traffic.
- Supports a least-recently-used in-memory cache for performance.
- Gracefully reads from multiple different sources for the blockchain to balance between high-performance local data and remote data sources like the ZChain API.
- ZCash support (designed around a set of primitives to support other blockchains)
- Unit tested
